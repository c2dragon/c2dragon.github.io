Hi I'm Christian. I started my IT/Cybersecurity journey in 2022 and have been tinkering around with machines ever since. 

The purpose of this blog is to practice and showcase my ability as an aspiring security researcher. Hacked machines will have writeups in the form of a penetration test report. Blue team projects will be in the form of a security incident report.
